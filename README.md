# Hey, I'm Andi - Andreas Naumann
üëã Full-time software developer with a background in mechatronics engineering, based in Bavaria, Germany. I work at a mid-sized mechatronics company that‚Äôs involved in sectors like mechanical engineering, energy, automotive, aerospace, and medical tech.

## What I Do
I'm the team coordinator of a small software squad. We build digitalization solutions and custom software for internal assembly lines and test benches. From PLC/SPS programming at the base level, up to SCADA systems, where we design ASP.NET APIs for integration with databases, MES, and ERP systems.

Right now, our biggest gig is reworking our SCADA platform ‚Äî moving away from the old .NET Framework and WCF to shiny new .NET with dockerized ASP.NET APIs (with Swagger and the works).

## My Tech Stack & Passion Projects
I like automation, control systems, and code that moves real-world things, but I also really like all back-end stuff and architecture. My skill set includes:

- .NET & ASP.NET, Docker, Swagger (I really love dotnet!)
- PLC/SPS Programming, automation, SCADA
- MES/ERP integration
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP)

If it‚Äôs about creativity and finding solutions for problems, I‚Äôm in!

## Off The Clock
When I‚Äôm not coding or solving automation puzzles, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm up to:

‚òï Coffee Nerd: Obsessed with all brewing methods (except cold brew‚Äîunless I forget my coffee and it happens by accident).
üéÆ Gaming: Forza Horizon on my Xbox is my go-to escape. Fast cars, open roads, good times.
üö¥ Outdoors: I love hiking, cycling and running, or just being out in nature to recharge.
üë®‚Äçüëß Family Time: My daughter‚Äôs still little, and I love spending time with her, watching her explore the world.
üöê Camper Life: Road-tripping in my VW T5 camper van with my wife, listening to audiobooks, and seeing new things.
