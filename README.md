# Hi, I'm Andi - Andreas Naumann

Hi there! I'm a full-time software developer with a background in mechatronics engineering. I'm located in Germany, BY. Currently, I work at a medium-sized mechatronics company that operates in various sectors such as mechanical engineering, energy, automotive, aerospace, medical technology, as well as measurement and testing technology.

## Professional Experience
In my role, I serve as the team coordinator for a small software team. We specialize in creating digitalization solutions and software for internal assembly systems and test benches. My work spans across the entire automation pyramid, from the low-level PLC/SPS programming to the SCADA level, where we develop ASP.NET APIs for seamless integration with databases, MES and ERP systems.  
*(The SCADA is our biggest project - currently we are developing the second generation switching from the outdated .NetFramework and WCF to .NET and dockerized ASP.NET APIs (with Swagger etc.))*

## Skills and Interests
My areas of expertise include software development, mechatronics, automation, and industrial control systems. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to optimize manufacturing processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall productivity. I really like all the things that I can bring to life and movement with my code.

## Personal Interests
In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a range of hobbies and interests that bring me joy and balance.

- Coffee Enthusiast: I love exploring different kinds of coffee or brewing methods (except for cold brew (which I only accidentally make when I get distracted) - I don't understand this thing)
- Gaming: I enjoy playing Forza Horizon on my XBOX and immersing myself in the world of fast cars and exciting races.
- Outdoor Activities: Cycling, running, and being in nature help me stay active and refreshed.
- Family Time: I cherish spending quality time with my young daughter and creating beautiful memories together.
- Camping Adventures: Traveling with my VW Camper (T5) allows me to combine my love for adventure, freedom, and the joy of driving (while listening to audiobooks with my lovely wife)
